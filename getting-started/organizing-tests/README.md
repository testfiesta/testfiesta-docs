# ✍️ Organizing Tests

### Organizing test cases

Arrange your test cases into Test Folders , allowing for easy access and management.&#x20;

<details>

<summary>Test Folders</summary>

Think of these as your personal file organizer but for tests. You can set up folders and sub-folders in a tree-like structure, similar to how you would organize files on your computer. Create as many Test Folders as you need, and don't worry about putting a test in just one place—tests can be in multiple folders. This setup makes it a breeze to manage your tests and pull them up quickly when you need them for Test Runs. Visit the [Test Folders](../../projects-tab/test-cases-tab/test-folders.md) section to learn more.

### Organizing test case execution

Structure your test execution process by grouping related tests into Projects and Milestones. Use Test Runs to execute specific test cases and Test Plans to coordinate and configure multiple Test Runs, ensuring a smooth and organized testing workflow.

<details>

<summary>Projects</summary>

These are the big-picture containers for your work, consisting of various Milestones. Each Project helps you organize and oversee different testing phases or initiatives, providing a structured way to manage your testing efforts across multiple areas. For further information, check out the [Projects](../../projects-tab/projects-home-page/) section.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Milestones</summary>

Think of these as big checkpoints where you store and manage your Test Runs and Test Plans. They help you keep track of your testing progress and make it easier to manage everything. Explore the [Milestones](../../projects-tab/milestones-tab/) for more insights.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Test Plans</summary>

These pull together multiple Test Runs and allow you to apply different configurations. This is where you plan out your test strategy and set everything up. Find out additional information in the Test Plans.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Test Runs</summary>

These are collections of individual Test Cases. You set up a Test Run to execute specific tests. Head to the [Test Runs](../../projects-tab/test-runs-tab/) to uncover more.
