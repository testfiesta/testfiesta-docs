# Manage Testing Process

<details>

<summary>Step 1: Create a Project</summary>

Begin by setting up a new Project. A Project helps you organize and track different testing initiatives or phases. Simply navigate to the Projects section and choose the option to create a new project. Head to the [Creating New Projects](../../projects-tab/projects-home-page/creating-new-projects/) section to uncover more.

<summary>Step 2: Create Test Folder to Store Test Cases</summary>

Within your Test Cases Tab, create a Test Folder to store and organize your test cases. Test Folders allow you to group related test cases into a tree-like structure with folders and sub-folders. This makes it easier to manage and retrieve test cases as needed. Get more information by visiting the [Creating Test Folders](../../projects-tab/test-cases-tab/test-folders.md) section.

<summary>Step 3: Create a Test Case</summary>

Next, add individual Test Cases to your Test Folder. A Test Case defines a specific scenario to be tested and includes the steps to execute it, the expected outcomes, and any necessary details. Learn more by clicking on the [Creating Test Cases](../../projects-tab/test-cases-tab/creating-test-cases/) tab.

<summary>Step 4: Create a Test Run</summary>

Once your Test Cases are in place, you can create a Test Run to execute them. A Test Run is a collection of Test Cases that are executed together. To create a Test Run, go to the Test Runs section, choose to add a new run, and select the Test Cases you want to include. To explore further, navigate to the [Creating Test Runs](../../projects-tab/test-runs-tab/creating-test-runs/).

<summary>Step 5: Create a Test Plan</summary>

To coordinate and manage your Test Runs, create a Test Plan. A Test Plan includes multiple Test Runs and allows you to apply various configurations. Check the Test Plans section for more details.

<summary>Step 6: Create a Milestone</summary>

Finally, organize your Test Plans and Test Runs into Milestones. A Milestone serves as a significant checkpoint within your Project, helping you track progress and manage testing activities. Go to the Milestones section, create a new Milestone, and add the Test Plans and Test Runs you’ve created. Visit the [Creating Milestones](../../projects-tab/milestones-tab/creating-milestones/) to learn more.
