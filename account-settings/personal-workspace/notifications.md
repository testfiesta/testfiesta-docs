# Notifications

## System Notifications

#### Test cases

You can receive notifications when a Test Case is assigned to you or when a new comment is made on a Test case you are already assigned to.&#x20;

You can also set the method and frequency of Test Case notifications. You can receive notifications on TestFiesta only, or choose between an email once per day or an immediate email for every notification.&#x20;
