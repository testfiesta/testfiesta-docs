# Data colors

Your Test Case status can be Active, Passed, Incomplete, or Failed and are represented by the colors blue, green, yellow, and red respectively. Charts, Test Runs, Defects, and Priority can also be assigned colors to represent status or type based on the needs of your Organization as shown in the images below.&#x20;

You can change the color for each status by clicking on the current color. A "Pick color" menu will appear and you may pick a new color using the color slider and chart. For this example we will change the Test Case "Active" status color and the Defects "New" status color.&#x20;
