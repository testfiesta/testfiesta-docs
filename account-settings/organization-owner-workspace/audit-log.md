# Audit Log

Using TestFiesta's Audit Log, you will be able to see all changes your Organization's users make within their settings or any projects they are a part of in a chronological order. First we will explain each column in an Audit Log.&#x20;

## Audit Log Columns

* Date: This column shows the date and time an update was made
* Project Name: If an update was made to an Organization project, the project name will appear here
* Entity Type: This column will tell you the broad section that was changed. Types include Settings, Milestone, Priority, Status, and Test Run
* Entity Name: This will give you a better idea of what kind of change was made. Some examples are notification\_preferences, user\_permissions, and api\_integrations.
* Action: This will tell you if a change was an update, assignment, comment, creation, or deletion
* Actor: The user who made the change
* Mode: This column will tell you if the change was done in UI mode or API mode.&#x20;
