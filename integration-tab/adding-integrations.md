# Adding Integrations

<details>

<summary>Step 1: Click "Add" on the app you want to integrate</summary>

Navigate to the "All" tab and pick an app to integrate (this example will use GitHub). Click "Add." This will take you to a page to confirm your sign in and access information for that app.&#x20;

<summary>Step 2: Fill in access information for the integrating app, then click "Continue" </summary>

In this case, we need an access token from GitHub, the user URL and to make a name for the integration. Once entered, click "Continue"&#x20;

<summary>Step 4: Select item for integration</summary>

This page will give you an option of what to integrate from your account on the integrating app. Every app will have different options for integration. In this case, we will integrate the bug-bounty-central repository from GitHub.&#x20;

Congrats, you can now add an Integration! You can also edit integrations to add them to more projects and bring more items into TestFiesta. We will show you how to do that on the next page&#x20;
