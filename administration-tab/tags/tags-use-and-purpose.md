# Tags Use and Purpose

Looking for a way to stay organized with all your information? Tags in the app make it easy! Apply them to users, roles, milestones, test cases, test runs, and defects to quickly filter and find exactly what you need. This feature helps streamline your workflow, manage projects more effectively, and track progress effortlessly.

Tags are listed in the Administration section under the “Tags”  tab.

Tags can be applied to the following categories:

* Users: Tags can group users into teams, departments, or project groups, making it easier to manage and find specific users.
