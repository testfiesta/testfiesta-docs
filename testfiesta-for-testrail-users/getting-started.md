# Getting Started

## Onboarding steps

This section will walk TestRail users through the initial steps to start using TestFiesta, from creating an account to setting up your team and exploring optional migration and integration options. Each step builds on TestRail’s familiar workflows, making onboarding straightforward.

<summary>👤 Step 1: Create A Personal Account </summary>

* **Action:** Sign up for a free personal account at [app.testfiesta.com/signup](https://app.testfiesta.com/signup) by entering your email, username, first name, last name, and password.
* **Details:** No payment is required. This creates a private workspace for solo testing, where you can create test cases, runs, and plans without collaboration features. It’s similar to a single-user TestRail project but allows experimentation with TestFiesta’s features like tags and dashboards.
* **For TestRail Users:** Unlike TestRail’s immediate project setup, TestFiesta’s private workspace lets you test the platform before committing to team workflows.
* **Tip:** Explore the private workspace to try creating a test case or viewing the dashboard before moving to team setup.

<summary>🛠️  Step 2: Create An Organization</summary>

* **Action:** Upgrade to an organization workspace ($10 per user/month) to enable team collaboration. From your personal account, go to Admin > Organizations, click “Create Organization,” and follow the prompts to set it up.
* **Details:** An organization unlocks user invitations, role assignments (e.g., Tester, Admin, Owner), and integrations (e.g., Jira, TestRail). Invite team members via Admin > Users by entering their emails and assigning roles/tags (e.g., “QA Team”). You can join multiple organizations and switch between them via the dashboard. A 14-day free trial lets you invite unlimited users to test collaborative features.
* **For TestRail Users:** This mirrors TestRail’s user management but adds tags for user filtering and project-level roles for granular control, unlike TestRail’s rigid permissions.
* **Tip:** Start with a trial organization to test team workflows. Use tags to organize users by department (e.g., “Mobile QA”). See [docs.testfiesta.com/administration-tab/users/inviting-a-user](https://docs.testfiesta.com/administration-tab/users/inviting-a-user).

<summary>⬇  Step 3: Migrate From TestRail (Optional)</summary>

* **Action:** Connect TestFiesta to external tools like Jira, GitHub, or CI/CD pipelines to enhance testing workflows.
* **Details:** Integrations include issue tracking (Jira, GitHub), storage (AWS, Google Cloud, Dropbox), and automation via tacotruck. These streamline defect management and automated result reporting. For setup instructions, see the Integration Deeper Dive section (for issue tracking and storage) and API and Automation section (for tacotruck).
* **For TestRail Users:** TestFiesta’s integrations are more streamlined than TestRail’s plugins, with tacotruck simplifying automation compared to TestRail’s API scripting.
* **Tip:** Test integrations in a staging project to ensure compatibility. Use Help & Feedback for setup issues.

<summary>👣 Step 4: Next Steps</summary>

After completing these steps, create a project in the Projects tab to organize test cases, explore demo projects to learn features, and use dashboards to track progress. TestFiesta’s intuitive setup makes transitioning from TestRail seamless. For support, visit [docs.testfiesta.com](https://docs.testfiesta.com) or use Help & Feedback.
