* Average time in status

You can edit each type of Line chart based on Test Cases, Test Runs, Defects, and Milestones. You can also adjust the view and filter different options in each Line chart. The following pages will outline each Line chart and their specific edit options.

On the next page, we will look at a specific type of Line chart: Progress Line charts. Click "Next"&#x20;
