# Open Vs Closed Milestones

## Open Milestones

Open milestones can have a status applied to them and can be selected in places like Dashboards and Reports for their respective purposes.&#x20;

## Closed Milestones

Closed Milestones cannot be selected for Dashboards or Reports, and have a "Closed" status applied to them by default. This status indicates that a Milestone has been reached based on certain criteria, or was closed for other reasons. It is still available to view in the Closed tab or calendars.
