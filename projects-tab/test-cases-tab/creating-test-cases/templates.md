  TestFiesta has four standard templates: Text, Steps, Exploratory session, and
  Behavior Driven Development. This page will show each of them and their
  intended purpose.

# Templates

## Text Template

Text template includes the standard fields Name, ID, Test Folder (if if one has already been created), Priority, Tags, and Add Attachment. This template also has three unique fields called Pre-condition, Steps, and Expected result which allow users to plan a simple, single step test&#x20;

## Steps Template

Steps Templates add more standard fields than Text templates like Priority, Tag, and Add Attachments. They also include unique fields called "Steps."&#x20;

These allow users to list out the step-by-step process of testing a feature or product and the expected outcomes of each action. The next page will show you how to add and remove Steps, as well as adding "Child Steps"

## Exploratory Session

Exploratory session templates have the same standard fields as a Steps templates, but with two unique fields called "Mission" and "Goals." This template is designed for more free-form exploratory testing using a mission and a list of goals they want to achieve rather than specific tests.

## Behavior Driven Development

Behavior Driven Development (BDD) templates allow the user to structure their tests around BDD conditions such as "Given," "When," and "Then." This means that the user can establish that "Given" a certain scenario, "When" something happens, "Then" this should happen.

You may also create a custom template by adding or removing any standard fields, and creating your own custom fields. The "Next" section will show you how to add and remove fields.&#x20;
