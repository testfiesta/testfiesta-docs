# Creating Test Cases

<details>

<summary>Step 1: Open the Test Cases tab </summary>

The Test Cases tab can be found on the left side of the Projects section&#x20;

</details>

<details>

<summary>Step 2: Create a Test Folder (Optional) </summary>

A Test Folder is a custom category you can make for your Test Cases to sort them.&#x20;

For this demonstration, we will make an "Android" Test Folder to put our Test Case into by clicking "Create test folder," typing in "Android" beside the folder icon, and pressing enter.&#x20;

You may also make a Test Folder later to sort Test Cases into.&#x20;

<summary>Step 4: Pick a Name </summary>

Name your Test Case to reflect the test you want to run.&#x20;

For example: "Successfully Login" if you wanted to run a test for successfully logging in to an app or software. For all default templates, the name is all that is required to create a Test Case

<summary>Step 6: Fill in Template fields (optional) </summary>

You may fill in all the fields for the template you have chosen. You can also choose to edit the Test Case later and fill in the templates then.&#x20;
