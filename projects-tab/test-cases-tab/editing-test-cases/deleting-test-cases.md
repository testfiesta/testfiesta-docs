This will remove your Test Cases from your available list, but not remove them from any Test Runs they are attached to currently.

Deleted Test Cases can be recovered by an Admin in the Audit Log. You can see how to recover files in the audit log [here](../../../organization-owner-workspace/audit-log.md)
