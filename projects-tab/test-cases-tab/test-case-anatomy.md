# Test Case Anatomy

So what is a Test Case? A Test Case is how users will plan out feature testing by deciding what tests they want to run, the priority, and a description of the tests. Test Cases also allow teams to track their testing progress and report any defects they find.

<summary>Templates</summary>

TestFiesta Templates provide the user with standardized types of Test Cases for different intended objectives. Default Templates include Text, Steps, Exploratory session, and Behavior Driven Development. If you wish to create your own template, a custom option is also available.

<summary>ID</summary>

An ID is automatically assigned to each Test Case when it is created.&#x20;

The first Test Case created in a Test Suite will be assigned the ID HM-1, while each subsequent Test Case in the same Test Folder will numerically increase by one (HM-2, HM-3).&#x20;

You can overwrite the ID using your own preferred methodology as long as all IDs are unique.
