Allows you to filter and organize Projects by Users, Table, and column views.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Archive/Unarchive Tabs</summary>

Allows you to change a project status to "Active" or "Archived". Each category changes the way you interact with and view your Projects.&#x20;

</details>

<details>

<summary>Delete</summary>

Allows you to delete a Project. Deleting a project will remove it from your Project List view and delete all data.
