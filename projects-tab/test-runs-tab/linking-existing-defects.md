<summary>Step 2: Confirm creation of a new Defect</summary>

A notification will appear asking if you would like to confirm the creation of a new Defect. \

Hit "Create new Defect" to continue or "Skip" to set the failed status to the Test Case without adding a new Defect.

<summary>Step 3: Linking the defect to a Test Case</summary>

A sidebar will appear on the right with fields to include Defect information. You can also place a link in the field when referring to an already existing Defect.
