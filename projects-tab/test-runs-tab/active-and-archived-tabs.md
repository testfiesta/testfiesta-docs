# Active & Archived Tabs

## Active Test Runs

Active Test Runs can be edited, have Test Cases added & executed, etc. Every Test Run you want to interact with should be Active.

## Archived Test Runs

An Archived Test Run is one you no longer want to use but you don't want to delete because you want to keep the data associated with it.&#x20;

Test Runs are displayed in Table View and in multiple columns. The next page will explain both Table View and show you how to change columns. Click "Next" &#x20;
