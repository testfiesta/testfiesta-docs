# Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)

Two-factor authentication requires users to have a second form of confirming their identity on top of their login password. This helps to keep user accounts secure. TestFiesta has two methods of using two-factor authentication: A text message or an authentication app. To see how to set up two-factor authentication for your account click [here](../../account-settings/general-settings/security/two-factor-authentication-2fa/).

You may enable two-factor authentication for your Organization, meaning all users who are invited to your Organization will be required to set up two-factor authentication for their account.

Enable two-factor authentication for your Organization by clicking the slider shown in the image below

As an added layer of security, you can require your Organization members to log in again after a specified time of being inactive. To learn more about the timeout feature, click "Next."
